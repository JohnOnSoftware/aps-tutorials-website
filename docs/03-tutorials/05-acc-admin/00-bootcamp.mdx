# Bootcamp Prerequisites

## ACC Account Sandbox

:::caution
Only Autodesk Construction Cloud(ACC) is applicable, BIM 360 is not applicable for this tutorial.
:::

:::warning
It's strongly recommend to apply for a Sandbox of ACC Account to play with 
during the bootcamp class, because it's very risky to work directly with your ACC Account 
which is in production. About how to apply for a trial account, please find options 
on this [BLOG](https://fieldofviewblog.wordpress.com/2017/08/31/bim-360-acc-account-for-development/)
:::

:::tip
To access the ACC Account, your ACC Account has to provision access for a specific APS application 
based on its client ID. Please refer to [Provision access in other products](/#provision-access-in-other-products)
