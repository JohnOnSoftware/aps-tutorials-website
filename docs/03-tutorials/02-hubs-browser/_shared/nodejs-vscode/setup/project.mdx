Create a new folder for your project, navigate to it in the command line,
and initialize a new Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Next, install all the Node.js dependencies we're going to use. In this case it will be [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
(utility for initializing environment variables from a file), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) (web framework),
and [cookie-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-session) for handling cookie-based sessions, and finally the required APS SDK modules:

:::caution
As of April 2024 the APS SDK for Node.js is in beta, which means that the public interfaces can still change.
To avoid any potential issues, we recommend installing the specific versions of these packages as shown below.
:::

```bash
npm install --save dotenv express cookie-session
npm install --save @aps_sdk/autodesk-sdkmanager@0.0.7-beta.1
npm install --save @aps_sdk/authentication@0.1.0-beta.1
npm install --save @aps_sdk/data-management@0.1.0-beta.1
```

The `"dependencies"` in your `package.json` file should now look something like this
(potentially with slightly different version numbers):

```json
// ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@aps_sdk/authentication": "0.1.0-beta.1",
    "@aps_sdk/autodesk-sdkmanager": "0.0.7-beta.1",
    "@aps_sdk/data-management": "0.1.0-beta.1",
    "cookie-session": "^1.4.0",
    "dotenv": "^16.3.1",
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
// ...
```

Finally, let's create a couple more subfolders in your project folder that we're going to need later:

- `wwwroot` - this is where we're going to put all the client side assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)
- `routes` - this is where we're going to implement all the server endpoints
- `services` - here we're going to keep all the server-side logic that can be shared by different endpoints
