The interface is based on vanilla HTML5 & JavaScript. It essentially the same for any server-side, but there are a few differences: the Websocket implementation uses socket.io (Node.js) or SignalR (.NET 6).
Let's start with the UI (HTML and JavaScript) files. Under wwwroot folder, create bundles and js folder.

<CodeBlockTabs NET6={IndexHtmlForNET} NodeJS={IndexHtmlForNode} />

## ApsDesignAutomation.js

Create js folder under public folder and Under public/js folder create the ApsDesignAutomation.js file with the following content

<CodeBlockTabs NET6={DAJSForNET} NodeJS={DAJSForNode} />
